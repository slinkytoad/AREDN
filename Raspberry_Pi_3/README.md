# Pi 3

This node will run matrix and/or the email client

## thoughts

this is up for discussion as to which type of text based communications are best.

- email
    - can send attachements
    - could possibly be setup to send outside the mesh
- matrix
    - modern UI
    - can be tied in with other Auth sources
- IRC
    - simple
    - easy to use with out an auth provider
    - no registration needed to make this work for everyone
    - https://github.com/ergochat/ergo/tree/master
